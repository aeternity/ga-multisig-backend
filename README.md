# Multisig Backend

This is the optional backend for ux optimization to use the [ga-multisig-ui](https://github.com/aeternity/ga-multisig-ui). It indexes multisig accounts per signer and exposes a key-value storage for transaction hash to raw transaction. In the future a signature challenge is to be added to some endpoints.
